## How Amazon Q Helped

This project was built using Amazon Q Developer CLI and guided by natural language prompts.  
I used Q to:

- Set up the Pygame window and frame logic  
- Learn how to handle input and movement  
- Implement bullet shooting mechanics  
- Understand concepts like `pygame.Rect`, `screen.blit()`, and game loops  
- Debug and polish gameplay logic

Although Amazon Q generated some starter code, the majority of logic and structure was written and understood manually by me, for learning purposes.
